TikoCache
============

Tiko stands for Tijdelijke Kopie, or Temporary Copy in Dutch.  

This library aims to flexibly allow for both simple and very complex caching needs: from simple cache per URL without loading a framework/CMS, to a complex set of dependent parameters (like logged in user) that can only be known once the framework/CMS starts.

Tiko is both flexible and efficient.

I'll explain on the rationale later :-) Here and in some blog post.
